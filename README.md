# Amazon Data Scraper Api

This project was built using Node.JS and Express as my framework to create a server for my backend application to build the Amazon Scraper API.

This API  allows users to access product, price, sales rank, and reviews data from Amazon in JSON format.

The project was deployed on Rapid API site.

The link to the live API can be seen below.
